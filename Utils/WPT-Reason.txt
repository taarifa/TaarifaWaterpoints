MATENGENEZO VISIMA VYA MAJI (Avifanyi kazi)
 -Kisima cha maji kimefungwa
 -Vifaa vyote vimetolewa
 -Kambi ya wakimbizi imefungwa
 -Viongozi wa kijiji wamekubaliana
 -Mwili wa mtu umekutwa ndani ya kisima
 -Hakuna Mawasiliano
 -Akija fanya kazi tangu kitengenezwe
 -Maji machafu
 -Maji machache
 -Akuna aja ya kisima
 -Imeunganishwa Kisima kilicho

kalibu VISIMA VINAVYO ITAJI (Avifanyi kazi lakini havija telekezwa)

WATERPOINT NEEDS FIXING (inactive but not yet abandoned)
Accumulation  (but cf. "Intake" below)
 - of sand
 - blocked by mud
"Broken"
 - careless use
Insufficient water supply
 - water diverted (e.g. to another village)
 - drought
 - seasonal
 - supply low (ran/running dry)
 - pressure low (not the same as supply low. Might be same as pump insufficient)
Free-flowing water
Destroyed
 - Destroyed by floods
Poorly maintaned
 - lack of supervision
 - poor management
 - leadership problems
Poor water quality
 - bad taste of water
 - saline / salty
 - defecation at site
Cost
 - bill not paid
 - no fuel
Land rights
 - conflict
Collapsed
 - caving-in: soil fallen into hole (well?)
 - earthquake
Construction incomplete
Dam
 - collapsed
 - silted-up
Pump insufficient
 - too weak: not pumping water up
 - (is this different from Insufficient water supply? I think so)
Under construction
Too much resistance on the hand pump
Outdated equipment
